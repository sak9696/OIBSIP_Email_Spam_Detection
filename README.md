# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting whether an email is **Spam or Not Spam** using Machine Learning techniques.  
The model is trained on textual email data and classifies messages based on learned patterns.  
This project was completed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**, fulfilling all assigned requirements and extending beyond them with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand text-based data and spam patterns
- Convert raw email text into numerical features
- Build a robust Machine Learning classification model
- Accurately classify unseen emails as Spam or Ham

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Publicly available email spam dataset
- Contains labeled email messages (Spam / Ham)
- Text data preprocessed before model training

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning
- **NLTK** – Text preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization

---

## 🔹 Task Requirements (As Assigned)
✔️ Loaded and explored the email dataset  
✔️ Cleaned and preprocessed textual data  
✔️ Converted text into numerical features  
✔️ Built a Machine Learning classification model  
✔️ Evaluated model performance  

---

## ⭐ Advanced Work (Beyond the Task)
- Implemented **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques:
  - Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
  - Stopword removal
  - Tokenization
- Used **TF-IDF Vectorization** instead of simple Bag-of-Words
- Compared multiple models for better performance
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Built a **custom email input system** for real-time spam prediction
- Visualized model performance using **Confusion Matrix**
- Ensured reproducible and well-structured ML pipeline

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Used:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- The model achieves high accuracy while effectively reducing false positives

---

## 📈 Visualization
- Confusion Matrix for classification performance
- Spam vs Ham distribution analysis
- Model prediction insights

---

## 🚀 Results
The final model successfully classifies emails with high accuracy and demonstrates practical application of NLP and Machine Learning in cybersecurity and communication filtering.
